## Requirments
- ESPnet and its required dependencies
- Additional packages used for scoring can be found in `./scoring/requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use this code, please:
1. Replace the original ESPnet code with code under the `./espnet2-patch` directory
2. Run ESPnet ASR recipe (refer to [Librispeech recipe](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/librispeech/asr1)) using configurations under the `./config` directory
3. After ESPnet scoring, additionally perform permutation-invariant scoring with `./scoring/run_pi_scoring.sh`

`./run.sh` provides a running demo for more useful details. Please note that this code was developed under <b>ESPnet 202209 version</b> and could be incompatible with later versions.
